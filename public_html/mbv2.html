<p>Mr. Hooper had the reputation of a good preacher, but not an energetic one: he strove to win his people heavenward by mild, persuasive influences, rather than to drive them <a href="#" class="hintanchor" onMouseover="showhint('thither = there', this, event, '150px')">thither</a> by the thunders of the Word. The sermon which he now delivered was marked by the same characteristics of style and manner as the general series of his pulpit <a href="#" class="hintanchor" onMouseover="showhint('pulpit oratory = his other sermons', this, event, '150px')">oratory</a>. But there was something, either in the <a href="#" class="hintanchor" onMouseover="showhint('sentiment = ideas', this, event, '150px')">sentiment</a> of the <a href="#" class="hintanchor" onMouseover="showhint('discourse = speech', this, event, '150px')">discourse</a> itself, or in the imagination of the <a href="#" class="hintanchor" onMouseover="showhint('auditors = listeners', this, event, '150px')">auditors</a>, which made it greatly the most powerful effort that they had ever heard from their pastor's lips. It was tinged, rather more darkly than usual, with the gentle gloom of Mr. Hooper's temperament. The subject had reference to secret sin, and those sad mysteries which we hide from our nearest and dearest, and <a href="#" class="hintanchor" onMouseover="showhint('would fain = would like to', this, event, '150px')">would fain</a> conceal from our own consciousness, even forgetting that <a href="#" class="hintanchor" onMouseover="showhint('the Omnisicent = God, the all-knowing', this, event, '150px')">the Omniscient</a> can detect them. A subtle power was breathed into his words. Each member of the congregation, the most innocent girl, and the man of hardened breast, felt as if the preacher had crept upon them, behind his awful veil, and discovered their hoarded <a href="#" class="hintanchor" onMouseover="showhint('hoarded iniquity of deed or thought = bad things they have done that they hope no one knows about', this, event, '150px')">iniquity</a> of deed or thought. Many spread their clasped hands on their bosoms. There was nothing terrible in what Mr. Hooper said, at least, no violence; and yet, with every tremor of his <a href="#" class="hintanchor" onMouseover="showhint('melancholy = sad', this, event, '150px')">melancholy</a> voice, the hearers quaked. An unsought <a href="#" class="hintanchor" onMouseover="showhint('pathos = pity, compassion', this, event, '150px')">pathos</a> came hand in hand with awe. So sensible were the audience of some <a href="#" class="hintanchor" onMouseover="showhint('unwonted attribute = unusual quality', this, event, '150px')">unwonted</a> attribute in their minister, that they longed for a breath of wind to blow aside the veil, almost believing that a stranger's <a href="#" class="hintanchor" onMouseover="showhint('visage = face, countenance', this, event, '150px')">visage</a> would be discovered, though the form, gesture, and voice were those of Mr. Hooper.</p>

<p>At the close of the services, the people hurried out with <a href="#" class="hintanchor" onMouseover="showhint('indecorous = inappropriate', this, event, '150px')">indecorous</a> confusion, eager to communicate their pent-up amazement, and conscious of lighter spirits the moment they lost sight of the black veil. Some gathered in little circles, huddled closely together, with their mouths all whispering in the centre; some went homeward alone, wrapt in silent meditation; some talked loudly, and <a href="#" class="hintanchor" onMouseover="showhint('profaned = showed no respect for', this, event, '150px')">profaned</a> the Sabbath day with <a href="#" class="hintanchor" onMouseover="showhint('ostentatious = showy', this, event, '150px')">ostentatious</a> laughter. A few shook their <a href="#" class="hintanchor" onMouseover="showhint('sagacious = wise', this, event, '150px')">sagacious</a> heads, <a href="#" class="hintanchor" onMouseover="showhint('intimating = suggesting, hinting', this, event, '150px')">intimating</a> that they could penetrate the mystery; while one or two affirmed that there was no mystery at all, but only that Mr. Hooper's eyes were so weakened by the midnight lamp, as to require a shade. After a brief interval, forth came good Mr. Hooper also, in the rear of his flock. Turning his veiled face from one group to another, he paid due reverence to the <a href="#" class="hintanchor" onMouseover="showhint('hoary = white-haired', this, event, '150px')">hoary</a> heads, saluted the middle aged with kind dignity as their friend and spiritual guide, greeted the young with mingled authority and love, and laid his hands on the little children's heads to bless them. Such was always his custom on the Sabbath day. Strange and bewildered looks repaid him for his courtesy. None, as on former occasions, aspired to the <a href="#" class="hintanchor" onMouseover="showhint('aspired to the honor = hoped to be the one who got to walk next to the Pastor', this, event, '150px')">honor</a> of walking by their pastor's side. Old Squire Saunders, <a href="#" class="hintanchor" onMouseover="showhint('&quot;Doubtless by an accidental lapse of memory&quot; &mdash; What tone do you hear in this phrase?', this, event, '150px')">doubtless</a> by an accidental lapse of memory, neglected to invite Mr. Hooper to his table, where the good clergyman had been <a href="#" class="hintanchor" onMouseover="showhint('wont to = accustomed to', this, event, '150px')">wont</a> to bless the food, almost every Sunday since his settlement. He returned, therefore, to the parsonage, and, at the moment of closing the door, was observed to look back upon the people, all of whom had their eyes fixed upon the minister. A sad smile gleamed faintly from beneath the black veil, and flickered about his mouth, glimmering as he disappeared.</p>

<p>&quot;How strange,&quot; said a lady, &quot;that a simple black veil, such as any woman might wear on her bonnet, should become such a terrible thing on Mr. Hooper's face!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Something must surely be amiss with Mr. Hooper's intellects,&quot; observed her husband, the physician of the village. &quot;But the strangest part of the affair is the effect of this <a href="#" class="hintanchor" onMouseover="showhint('vagary = irresponsible whim', this, event, '150px')">vagary</a>, even on a sober-minded man like myself. The black veil, though it covers only our pastor's face, throws its influence over his whole person, and makes him ghostlike from head to foot. Do you not feel it so?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Truly do I,&quot; replied the lady; &quot;and I would not be alone with him for the world. I wonder he is not afraid to be alone with himself!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Men sometimes are so,&quot; said her husband.</p>
