<li>Find and list at least 10 technological developments Twain mentions that do not belong in the sixth century.  Which of them have survived to our own time?  What changes have they undergone in the past 110 years?  Choose one of those developments to research in depth; write a 3- 5 page paper about it. <p>

<li>Construct a model of Merlin's Tower just before Morgan blows it up, the fountain in the Valley of Holiness, or Merlin's Cave after the battle.  Include the technology Morgan mentions.<p>

<li>In what ways might the novel have been different if Twain had not known about steam power, the telephone, or the telegraph (choose one)?<p> 
<li>The original illustrator of the novel designed a placard for Persimmon's Soap to look like this: <A HREF="http://twain.lib.virginia.edu/yankee/cyadshp.html">Persimmon's Soap</a>.  Design a similar ad for another product mentioned in the novel.  Compare these ads with modern ads.  In what ways are they similar?  In what ways are they different? <p>

<li>In Chapter 33 Hank Morgan refers to "the creators of this world--after God--Gutenberg, Watt, Arkwright, Whitney, Morse, Stephenson, Bell (218)."  Choose one of these men and investigate what he invented, how he did it, and who helped him.  Present your research by pretending to be one of the inventors (or a helper or family member) and give a speech about your life and achievements.<p>

<li>Hank Morgan introduces the steam engine, steamships, and Bessemer steel to sixth century England.  What natural resources must he use to do that?  What effect might these technologies have on the environment?  Present your findings in the form of a debate between a team of Morgan's engineers and a team of sixth century environmentalists.<p>
  
<li>Electrical power was still in its infancy in 1889 and is not mentioned much in this novel.  Think about the implications of electrical power on Arthurian England.  Rewrite one chapter in this novel, showing what it might have been like had Camelot had access to large amounts of electricity.<p>

<li>Research smallpox and explain Morgan's admiration for King Arthur:<em>  "Here was heroism at its last and loftiest possibility, its utmost summit; this was challenging death in the open field unarmed, with all the odds against the challenger, no reward set upon the contest, and no admiring world in silks and cloth-of-gold to gaze and applaud ..."</em> (Twain 193).  Present the results of your thinking as a speech in which you present King Arthur with a medal for his heroism or as a proclamation declaring "King Arthur Day."<p>

<li>As the novel closes, Sandy and Hello Central are in France.  What do you think might happen to them?  Will they be reduced to poverty like the young woman in Chapter 35?  Or will Sandy, who surprises Morgan again and again, take action?  Write a chapter or two from Sandy's journal after Hank's return to England.<p>

<li>Clarence writes the final entry in Hank's journal.  What might Clarence's own journal have said?  Describe the major events of the novel from his viewpoint, remembering that he is a native of Camelot.<p>

<li>Choose a modern product that Twain didn't know about.  What effect might this technological development have had in Arthur's England?  In Twain's time?  Present the results of your thinking as a drawing, diorama, or skit.<p>
