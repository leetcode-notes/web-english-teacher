When England looks to the past for inspiration, one of the monarchs she holds in highest esteem is Henry V. His reputation has developed over the years in part based upon the biases of those who tell his story. In this unit we will examine the influences on the story of Henry V. We will also consider how those forces are at work today. <br>
