The spider had finally found sun way on the other side, spun the sun chunks in web and carried them back. The people all rejoiced and named the spider a sun god.";

bsrc.innerHTML="<dd> I asked my dad if he had any stories about spiders. He said that he had the perfect story and that this topic was at the best of times. We are building a new patio in our backyard. The other night when him and my mom had got done working, and mom had already gone inside, dad decided to stay out there and enjoy what they had gotten done the past couple nights. They bought all new chairs, and tables, and everything for outside. My dad limped over to the chairs and got ready to take a seat. He was turning to put his bottom in the chair, when on the wall there was a huge black spot, and he jumped back up. He moved the chair to see what the black spot was on the white wall, which they had just painted the day before. When he looked, it was a huge black spider about the size of my palm. He said it was one of the biggest spiders he had saw in a long time, and if what he is saying is true, it is probably one of the biggest spiders that I have heard about around my house, and I hope that there isn’t anymore.";

bsrc.innerHTML="<dd> One summer quite some years ago I was outside playing in my moms fake flowers. I picked a couple pedals off one of them and was playing with then all day.  My middle brother Justin and I used to share a room and I had gone in our room to play. Justin wasn’t home so I was lying on his bed since I couldn’t when he was home. Being a forgetful child I had left the ripped up flower all over his bed and on the around next to his bed. Not cleaning my mess up I left the room to continue playing outside. After playing outside all day, about eight o’clock I had to come in and get ready for bed. By the time I was done my brother was home and getting ready for bed too. I went ahead and was lying in bed. Justin came in and got into his bed also. I guess Justin wasn’t ready to go to sleep, and reached beside his bad on the floor to pick up a magazine. While feeling around Justin felt one of the little pedals I had been playing with and thought it was a spider. He started screaming, which made me get up, and we both ran out of the room.";
