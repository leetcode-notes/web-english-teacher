Conclusion
</font>
<br><br>

<font face="arial, geneva, sans-serif" size="3">
<p>Sometimes history is not as clear as we would like to think.</p>

<p>If John Smith's story of Pocahontas saving his life is false, then both he and Disney are guilty of misleading people. If he lied, Smith misled people in England who had no way of finding out the truth. If Smith's story is false, Disney has misled people who are too young to even question what they are watching.</p>

<p>Even if Smith's story is true, Disney has changed many details. Their very young audience will not understand, for example, the difference in ages between the real Pocahontas and Smith.</p>

<p>Some would say that a work that is intended as entertainment does not have to be historically accurate. They say what's important is the lesson young children learn:  respect nature and respect other people.</p>

<p>Others would say that a movie like <em>Pocahontas</em> presents a stereotype in the name of profits. </p>

<p>Is an apology appropriate in this situation? Pocahontas helped the colonists at Jamestown time and time again, and the kindness of the Powhatan people was ultimately repaid with disrespect and violence. In this WebQuest you have researched the incident and decided whether Disney's <em>Pocahontas</em> is simple entertainment or another act of disrespect.</p>
