<p>You work for the Board of Directors of the Disney corporation. It has been 10 years since the release of <em>Pocahontas</em>, and once again the Powhatan people have asked Disney to apologize for the movie. The people who are currently on the Board were not on the Board when the video was released, and they have agreed to consider the request. They have asked you to investigate and make a recommendation. </p>

<p>Investigate the facts of what happened at Jamestown. Decide for yourself whether the Powhatan people are right in asking for an apology. Write a memo to the Board recommending a course of action.</p>
