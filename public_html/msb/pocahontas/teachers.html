This WebQuest is designed for high school juniors and addresses the following Indiana standards:<br><br>

<ul type="square">
<li>11.2.1--Analyze both the features and the rhetorical (communication) devices of different types of public documents, such as policy statements, speeches, or debates, and the way in which authors use those features and devices.
<li>11.2.3--Verify and clarify facts presented in several types of expository texts by using a variety of consumer, workplace, and public documents.
<li>11.2.4--Make reasonable assertions about an author's arguments by using elements of the text to defend and clarify interpretations.
<li>11.2.5--Analyze an author's implicit and explicit assumptions and beliefs about a subject.
<li>11.2.6--Critique the power, validity, and truthfulness of arguments set forth in public documents; their appeal to both friendly and hostile audiences; and the extent to which the arguments anticipate and address reader concerns and counterclaims.
<li>11.4--Writing Process<br>

<ul>
<li>use exposition, narration, description, argumentation, or some combination of rhetorical strategies to support the main argument;

<li>explain the perceived reason or reasons for the similarities and differences in historical records with information derived from primary and secondary sources to support or enhance the presentation;
<li>include information from all relevant perspectives and take into consideration the validity and reliability of sources; and
<li>include a formal bibliography.
</ul>
<li>11.5.6--Use varied and extended vocabulary, appropriate for specific forms and topics.
