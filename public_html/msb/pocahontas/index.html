<p>Jamestown was the first permanent settlement of the English in the New World. It would not have survived, though, if it hadn't been for two people: Pocahontas and John Smith.</p>

<p>Pocahontas and Smith saved the Jamestown colonists from starvation in different ways. Pocahontas arranged for the colonists to trade with the Powhatan people for food after the supplies brought from England were exhausted. Smith set up strict rules for the colonists, saying that those who did not work would not eat. If either one of them had failed, the colony probably would not have survived.</p> 

<p>But that isn't why they are famous. They are famous because Smith told the story of Pocahontas saving his life. For hundreds of years many people believed his story. Lately, however, some scholars have questioned it. </p>

<p>In 1995 Disney released a cartoon movie entitled <em>Pocahontas</em> that told a story of a young Native American woman named Pocahontas and an English explorer named John Smith. The movie outraged members of the Powhatan tribe and many of the descendants of Pocahontas while it was still in production. They said it was inaccurate. Disney released the movie, anyway.</p>

<p>Should Disney apologize to the Powhatan people for distorting the story of Pocahontas, John Smith, and the Jamestown settlers? Did they harm anyone in producing that movie? If a movie is based on someone's life, how accurate should it be? You will explore these questions in this WebQuest.</p>
