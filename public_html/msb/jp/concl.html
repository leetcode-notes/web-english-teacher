In <em>Jurassic Park</em> author Michael Crichton reminds readers that knowledge and judgement are not the same thing, and that gaining knowledge without also improving judgement can be very dangerous.</p>

<p>During this WebQuest you have developed your ability to judge the information on a Web site.  You know that you must be alert for signs of bias and for inaccuracies.</p>

<p>Good judgement is important, whether you're researching something online, watching a TV commercial, or listening to a politician speak.  </p>

<p>As essayist Michel Montaigne once wrote, "We can be knowledgeable with other men's knowledge, but we cannot be wise with other men's wisdom."</p>
