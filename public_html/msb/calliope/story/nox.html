According the Greek story of creation, at first there was nothing but Chaos.  Chaos was a huge, wild, disorganized void or "nothingness."  Chaos had two children:  Nyx and Erebus.  They were not gods to be worshipped.  They were personifications of concepts that storytellers used.<p>

Nyx laid an egg, and from it came love.  When Love was born, beauty and order came, too.  The confusion of Chaos began to disappear.  Love created Light and Day.<p>

In some stories, Nyx rode across the sky in a chariot, bringing night.  <p>

The Roman name for Nyx was Nox, and our English words come from Nox.<p>
