Phrygia was famous for its roses, and King Midas had wonderful gardens near his palace.  One day his servants found Silenus, a follower of the god of wine Bacchus, asleep among the roses.  Midas welcomed him and treated him as a royal guest for 10 days.  Then he helped Silenus rejoin Bacchus.<p>

Bacchus was so pleased with Midas that he promised Midas he would grant him one wish.  Midas wished that everything he touched would turn to gold.<p>

That night at dinner Midas could not eat or drink anything because it kept turning to gold in his mouth.  He went out to his garden for comfort, but the roses turned to gold when he touched them.  His young daughter ran outside and asked her daddy to pick her up.  Laughing, she grabbed his legs -- and instantly turned to gold.<p>

Horrified, Midas hurried back to Bacchus to beg him to take back the gift.  Bacchus sent him to bathe in source of the river Pactolus and to sprinkle river water on his daughter.  To this day people find gold in the sand from that river.<p>

This story helps us remember that some things are more important than wealth.<p>
