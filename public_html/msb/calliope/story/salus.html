Salus is the personified Roman goddess of health and prosperity, both of the individual and the state. She had a temple on the Quirinal, built in 302 BC. Later she became more a protector of personal health. Her attribute was a snake or a bowl and her festival was celebrated on March 30. <p>

Our English words <em>salute, salutation, salutatory,</em> and <em>salutatorian</em> are all derived from the name Salus, suggesting a greeting that includes wishes for good health.<p>  

Salus is identified with the Greek goddess Hygieia, from whose name we have our word <em>hygiene</em>.
