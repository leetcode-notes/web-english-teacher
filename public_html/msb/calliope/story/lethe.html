The river Lethe was also called the river of forgetfulness or oblivion.  It was one of five rivers separating the Greek underworld from the land of the living.  Those who drank water from the river Lethe forgot everything they had seen while they were in the Underworld.  Then they could return to Earth to be reincarnated (born in a new form).  Souls often became drowsy as they listened to the river's murmuring.<p>
