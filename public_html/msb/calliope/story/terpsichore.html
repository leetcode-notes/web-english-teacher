Terpsichore (pronounced "terp-SICK-ur-ee") was, like Calliope, a muse, one of the nine daughters of Zeus and a mortal woman.  Each was in charge of a different aspect of the arts.<p>

Terpsichore is mostly associated with dancing, though some stories put her in charge of choral singing (groups like choirs).  Her name comes from two Greek words meaning "to delight in dancing."<p>

This story is derived from information in <em>Mythology</em> by Edith Hamilton, published by Little, Brown, and Co. of Boston, 1942.<p>
