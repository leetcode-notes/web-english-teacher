Tantalus was the son of Zeus and a mortal mother.  The gods and goddesses liked Tantalus.  One time he invited all of them to his palace for a great banquet, and they all honored him by attending.<p>

No one has ever tried to explain what happened next.  Tantalus ordered his servants to kill his son Pelops, boil him in a cauldron, and serve him to the gods for dinner.  Of course the gods knew what was on the plates in front of them, and they refused to eat.  Instead, they restored Pelops to life, and they devised a unique and terrible punishment for Tantalus.<p>

Tantalus was chained in a pool in the underworld.  Around the pool were fruit trees heavy with ripe fruit.  Whenever he was hungry and reached for something to eat, a breeze blew the branches out of his reach.  When he was thirsty and tried to drink, the water drained into the ground.  When he stood up, it was there again.  He was condemned to spend eternity hungry and thirsty even though he was surrounded by food and water.<p>

Today our word <em>tantalize</em> suggests tempting someone with something he or she can't have.  Something <em>tantalizing</em> is very interesting or desirable.<p>
