Atlas was a Titan, a figure of great strength and power.  According to the stories, the Titans, led by Cronus, ruled the universe before the coming of the Olympian gods.  The son of Cronus, Zeus, was the leader of the Olympians.  He overthrew his father in a terrible battle and condemed all the Titans to bitter punishments.<p>

The punishment for Atlas was one of the worst.  He was condemned to hold the world on his shoulders. The earth and the sky were very heavy, and he had to carry the burden alone.<p> 

Atlas only had one visitor: Hercules (Roman name, Heracles). Hercules had to find the Golden Apples of the Hesperides.  Since Atlas was the father of the Hesperides, Hercules asked him for help.  Atlas said he would get the apples if Hercules would hold the earth and sky while he was gone.  Hercules agreed.  When Atlas returned with the apples, he said Hercules could just keep on holding the earth and sky and that Atlas would deliver the apples.<p>

Atlas wasn't planning to come back, so Hercules had to think fast.  He asked Atlas to hold up the earth and sky again for just a moment while Hercules put a pad on his shoulders.  Atlas did, and Hercules took the apples and left.<p>

Atlas also had a daughter named Maia. Her son was the Olympian god Hermes (Roman name, Mercury).<p>

Today we call a collection of maps an <strong><em>atlas</em></strong> and remember the name of the character who held the earth and sky.<p>
