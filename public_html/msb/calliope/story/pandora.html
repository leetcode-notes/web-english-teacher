Prometheus and Epimetheus were brothers during the Golden Age, when no evil existed on the Earth.  No one was ever sick or angry or hungry.  Everyone spent their days in peace and happiness.  Prometheus, whose name means "forethought," was a Titan and was very wise.  His brother's name meant "afterthought," and he made a terrible mistake.<p>

On Mount Olympus the gods created a young woman.  Each one gave her a special gift, such as a silvery gown, a golden crown, great beauty, and garlands of flowers.  They named her "Pandora," which means "the gift from all."<p>

The gods also gave Pandora a box.  Into that box each god had put something harmful, and they warned her never to open it.  Then they sent Pandora to Epimetheus.<p>

When he saw her beauty, Epimetheus forgot his brother's warning never to accept anything from Zeus.  He welcomed Pandora into his home and married her.<p>

One day Pandora's curiosity got the better of her.  She just had to know what was in the box the gods had given her, so she opened it.  Immediately all the troubles of the world flew out:  disease, anger, hunger, and many others.  Terrified, Pandora slammed down the lid, but it was too late.  The Golden Age was ruined.<p>

Pandora looked down at the box, startled.  Did she hear something inside knocking and saying, "Let me out"?  Pandora sighed.  No matter what was in there, it couldn't be any worse than what she had already let out, so she opened the box.  Out flew Hope, the only good thing the gods had included. <p>

Today Hope is often the only thing that sustains people during bad times. <p>
