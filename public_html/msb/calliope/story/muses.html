The nine Muses were daughters of Zeus and Mnemosyne (Memory).  Each one had an area of the arts they were in charge of.  
<ul>
<li>Calliope, epic poetry and eloquence
<li>Clio, history
<li>Erato, love poetry
<li>Euterpe, lyric poetry
<li>Melpomene, tragedy
<li>Polyhymnia, songs to the gods (hymns)
<li>Terpsichore, dance
<li>Thalia, comedy
<li>Urania, astronomy
</ul>

The Muses provided inspiration and joy.  Artists often asked their muse for help.  <a href="http://icdweb.cc.purdue.edu/~felluga/translation.html" target="_blank">Click here to see a variety of translations of the opening lines of Homer's <em>Odyssey</em></a>, all of them invoking the muse.
