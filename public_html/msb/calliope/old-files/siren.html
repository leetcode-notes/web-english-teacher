The Sirens had the heads of beautiful women and the bodies of birds. They lived on a rocky island in the sea. Their voices were enchanting, and everyone who heard them sing was drawn to them. Sailors would sail their ships onto the rocks and drown, trying to hear more of their lovely singing.<br><br>

Most people who heard them sing died. There are only two stories of survivors. On their famous adventure Jason and the Argonauts heard the Sirens. They fought the sound but eventually were overcome and began to sail their ship toward the rocky coast. Fortunately Orpheus was on board. Orpheus was a musician and singer of such skill that he broke the spell of the Sirens, and the sailors brought their ship, the Argo, back on course.<br><br>

Odysseus, hero of The Odyssey, had been warned in advance about the Sirens. He plugged the ears of his crew with beeswax, so they couldn't hear the captivating sound. But Odysseus himself wanted to hear the singing, so he had his men tie him to the mast. When the ship drew near the island, he was enchanted by the singing. Moving his head, he gestured to his men to untie him and let him swim to the island. Instead, they tied him even tighter. He begged, he pleaded, and as they sailed beyond the island, he wept. As they sailed further away, he returned to his senses.<br><br>

These are the only stories of men who heard the Sirens and escaped destruction.<br><br>
