Aspirin has a <em>salutary</em> effect, because it helps ease pain, reduce swelling, and fight fever.  Aspirin is one of the oldest medicines known: the earliest civilizations brewed tea from willow bark that contained the same chemicals as aspirin.  It was used to fight arthritis pain, among other things.  One side effect, however, was that it could be very hard on a person's stomach if used for long periods of time.  Modern aspirin, acetyl salicylic acid, contains the same medicine plus some compounds to reduce those side effects.<p>
