The Titans were a race of gods who lived before Zeus and the other Olympians. They were very big and very strong. Some of the most famous Titans were Cronus, Rhea, Ocean, Hyperion, Atlas, Epimetheus, and Prometheus, who gave fire to humans.<br><br>
Cronus and Rhea were the parents of Zeus and other Olympian gods and goddesses. Cronus knew that one of his children was destined to overthrow him. As each child was born, he swallowed it. When Zeus was born, though, Rhea wrapped a stone in a baby blanket and gave that to Cronus instead. She hid Zeus on an island. When he became an adult, he forced Cronus to disgorge the stone and his five brothers and sisters: Hera, Poseidon, Hades, Hestia, and Demeter. Then he waged a terrible war against Cronus and the Titans. After he won, he sentenced them to cruel punishments.<br><br>
