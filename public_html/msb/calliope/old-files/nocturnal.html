According the Greek story of creation, at first there was nothing but Chaos. Chaos was a huge, wild, disorganized void or "nothingness." Chaos had two children: Nyx and Erebus. Nyx and Erebus were not gods to be worshipped; they were personifications of the concepts of night (Nyx) and darkness (Erebus).<br><br>


Nyx laid an egg, and from it came love. When Love was born, beauty and order came, too. The confusion of Chaos began to disappear. Love created Light and Day.<br><br>

In some stories, Nyx rode across the sky in a chariot, bringing night. <br><br>

The Roman name for Nyx was Nox, and our English words come from Nox.<br><br>
