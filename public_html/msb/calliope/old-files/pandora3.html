<h3>That's right!<P>

Someone who opens Pandora's Box has caused a lot of problems.<P>

Computers, for example, have the potential to do many good things. However, they also invade our privacy, make inappropriate materials available to children, make it easy to download illegal videos and music, and help people waste a lot of time. Computers have opened a Pandora's Box of problems.<br><br>

Please <A HREF="psyche.html">go to the next word.</a>
