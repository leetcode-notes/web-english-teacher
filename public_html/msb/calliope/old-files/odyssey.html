<p>Odysseus, king of Ithaca, is the greatest of the Greek heroes. During the years of the Trojan War, Odysseus proved to be a natural leader. He was also very clever. In fact, he thought of the Trojan Horse, the trick which brought the war to an end. He is often referred to as "wily Odysseus."</p>
<p>When the Trojan War ended, Odysseus forgot to thank the gods for helping him. This made them angry, and they punished him with a long voyage home. The trip that should have taken about two weeks took 10 years instead. Along the way, Odysseus fought many monsters and misfortunes, was taken prisoner by Circe and Calypso, visited the land of the dead, and eventually lost all of his men. He was able to get home only because Athena changed her mind and helped him.</p>

<p>The story of Odysseus' long voyage with its unexpected twists and turns is told in Homer's epic poem, The Odyssey. Our English word comes from the title. </p>
