Many students first learn about Hercules by watching the Disney movie. In it they see a strong guy with a good heart and tremendous courage, but not a lot of brains. That's a good comparison to the Hercules of the ancient Greeks.<br><br>
Hercules ranks with Odysseus and Theseus as one of the greatest Greek heroes. The son of Zeus and a mortal woman, he killed a pair of snakes while he was still an infant. Everyone knew then that he was no ordinary child.</p>

<p>As an adult, he married the Theban princess Megara. He loved his wife and children, but one day in a fit of madness, he killed them all. When he came to his senses and realized what he had done, he was going to kill himself. However, the Theban ruler Theseus reached out and grasped Hercules' bloodstained hands. According to the Greek tradition, this made Theseus guilty, too.</p>

<p>This act of friendship saved Hercules' life. Theseus convinced Hercules to come to Athens. While he was there, Hercules consulted the oracle of Apollo. The oracle told him to go to King Eurystheus, who would provide tasks for Hercules as penance. If he completed what Eurythesus said, he would be purified from his guilt.</p>

<p>King Eurystheus devised a list called &quot;The Twelve Labors of Hercules.&quot; Each was all but impossible. Hercules undertook them willingly in order to atone for his crimes. 
<ul>
<li>The Nemean Lion<br>
Hercules had to kill the Nemean Lion, a huge, strong beast no weapon could harm. He choked it to death, then carried the carcass to the King.</li>
<li>The Hydra<br>
The Hydra had nine heads, one of which was immortal. The other eight were equally dangerous. If a warrior cut off one head, two more grew in its place. Hercules brought his nephew Iolus to help him. As Hercules cut off one head, Iolus seared the neck with a hot brand so a new head couldn't grow. After they cut off the eight mortal heads, Hercules buried the ninth one under a huge rock.</li>
<li>The Golden Stag<br>
This stag had horns of gold and was sacred to Artemis. Hercules had to capture it alive.</li>
<li>The Erymanthean Boar<br>
Hercules chased this monstrous wild hog until it was worn out. Then he trapped it in deep snow.</li>
<li>The Stables of King Augeus<br>
King Augeus had thousands of cattle and hadn't bothered to clean out his stables in years. Hercules rerouted two rivers to flood the stables and clean them quickly. </li>
<li>The Stymphalian Birds<br>
There were so many birds that the people of Stymphalus considered them a threat. Athena drove the birds out of their hiding places, and Hercules shot them with his arrows.</li>
<li>The Minoan Bull<br>
Hercules journeyed to the island of Crete and overpowered the savage bull that Poseidon had given King Minos. He put the bull on a boat and brought it to King Eurystheus.</li>
<li>The Mares of Diomedes<br>
These horses were a special challenge: they ate human flesh. Hercules had to kill King Diomedes first, and then he drove off the mares.</li>
<li>The Girdle (Belt) of Hippolyta<br>
Hippolyta was the Queen of the Amazons, a race of warrior women. She was willing to help him out and gave him the girdle. As he was leaving, the Amazons mistakenly thought Hercules was kidnapping Hippolyta, so they attacked his ship. Hercules, mistakenly thinking Hippolyta ordered the attack, killed her. He took the girdle and escaped.</li>
<li>The Cattle of Geryon<br>
Geryon was a monster with three bodies. He lived on Erythia, an island way in the west. On his way to get the cattle, Hercules set up two great stones, called the Pillars of Hercules. Today they are the mighty rocks Gibralter and Ceuta at the western entrance of the Mediterranean Sea.</li>
<li>The Golden Apples of the Hesperides<br>
No one knew where the golden apples were, but Eurystheus ordered Hercules to bring them to him. The Hesperides were the daughters of Atlas, so Hercules asked Atlas, the Titan who held up the sky, for help. Atlas asked Hercules to hold up the sky while he went for the apples. When he came back, he told Hercules to just keep on holding up the sky while he delivered the apples. Hercules knew was Atlas was up to. He said he would be glad to hold up the sky if Atlas would take it back for just a moment so he could put a pad on his shoulders. Atlas agreed. Hercules took the apples and left.</li>
<li>Cerberus, the Three-Headed Dog<br>
Hercules' last job was to bring Cerberus up from the Underworld. Hades, king of the underworld, agreed to let Cerberus go as long as Hercules didn't use any weapons on him. Hercules lifted Cerberus up and carried him to Eurystheus. Cereberus was very dangerous, so Eurystheus made Hercules take him back. That was the last of his labors. <br><br>
When he died, Hercules was taken to Mount Olympus to spend eternity with the gods and goddesses. </li></ul></p>

<p>Now that you have read about the 12 labors of Hercules, think carefully: which of these jobs could be considered <em>herculean</em>?


<ul>
<li><A HREF="herculean1.html">lifting a 20-lb weight</a></li>      
<li><A HREF="herculean2.html">sending someone to the moon and back safely</a></li>      
<li><A HREF="herculean3.html">using a snowblower to remove one inch of snow from the sidewalk</a></li> 
</ul></p>
