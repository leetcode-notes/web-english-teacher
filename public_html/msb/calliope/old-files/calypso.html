The great Greek hero Odysseus spent many years wandering the Mediterranean Sea after helping win the Trojan War. Eventually he lost all his ships and all his crew. He was trapped on an island with the nymph, Calypso, who loved him and wanted him to stay with her. She did everything she could to make his stay on her island a happy one.<br><br>
Odysseus, however, still wanted to return to his wife, Penelope; his son, Telemachus; and his kingdom, Ithaca. Finally Athena persuaded most of the Olympian gods that he should be allowed to return home. Zeus sent Hermes, his messenger, to tell Calypso that she had to let Odysseus leave her island.<br><br>

Calypso was angry and hurt. She had to obey, Zeus, though, and five days later Odysseus set sail on a strong raft.<br><br>

Today we call music from the Caribbean islands calypso music to remember the beautiful nymph and her island.<br><br>
