Vulcan was the Roman god of fire and the forge. As the Olympian blacksmith, he made furnishings, dwellings, and armor for the gods and goddesses. Some poets said Vulcan's forge was under volcanoes and caused smoke and fire to come from them during an eruption.<br><br>
Vulcan was liked and respected both by the gods and by people. He supported those who worked with their hands in trades and manufacturing.<br><br>
