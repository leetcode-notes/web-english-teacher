The nine Muses were daughters of Zeus and Mnemosyne (Memory). Each Muse was in charge of one area of the arts:  
<ul>

<li>Calliope, epic poetry and eloquence 
<li>Clio, history 
<li>Erato, love poetry 
<li>Euterpe, lyric poetry 
<li>Melpomene, tragedy 
<li>Polyhymnia, songs to the gods (hymns) 
<li>Terpsichore, dance 
<li>Thalia, comedy 
<li>Urania, astronomy 
</ul>
The Muses provided inspiration and joy. Artists often asked their muse for help. <a href="http://web.ics.purdue.edu/~felluga/translation.html">Click here to see a variety of translations of the opening lines of Homer's Odyssey</a>, all of them invoking the muse.
