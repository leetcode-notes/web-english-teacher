That's right!<P>

When the Pilgrims left first Holland, then England, they were looking forward to settling in the New World, where they would be free to worship as they pleased.<P>

Before long, though, they encountered unexpected hardships.  The voyage itself lasted nearly ten weeks and was troubled with rough seas.  An important beam in the middle of the ship broke, nearly causing them to have to turn back.  Three babies were born, and one person died.  It was a trip full of both joy and sorrow.<P>

Once they arrived, they couldn't find the piece of land that they had the charter for.  The captain and crew of the ship were in a hurry for the Pilgrims to get disembark so that they could head back to England.  And a horrible disease swept through the travelers and the crew.  Things were very bleak, and only their strong faith got them through it.<P>

"A long journey filled with unexpected twists and turns" is a good way to describe the journey of the Pilgrims.  It was quite an <em>odyssey</em>.
