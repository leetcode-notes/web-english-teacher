<h3>That's right!<P>

Someone who <em>somnambulates</em> is sleepwalking.<P>

Scientists have studied this interesting phenomenon for generations.  Recent studies have shown a burst of delta waves (shown in yellow in the graphic to the right) in the brain of someone who is sleepingwalking.  They theorize that the somnambulist triggers a portion of the brain that deals with emotion, and then the body, which is normally at rest, becomes involved.  A somnambulist is asleep the entire time he or she is moving about.<p>
