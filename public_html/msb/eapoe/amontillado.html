At the most remote end of the crypt there appeared another less spacious. Its walls had 

been lined with human remains, piled to the vault overhead, in the fashion of the great catacombs of Paris. Three sides of 

this interior crypt were still ornamented in this manner. From the fourth side the bones had been thrown down, and lay 

promiscuously upon the earth, forming at one point a mound of some size. Within the wall thus exposed by the displacing of 

the bones, we perceived a still interior crypt or recess, in depth about four feet, in width three, in height six or seven. 

It seemed to have been constructed for no especial use within itself, but formed merely the interval between two of the 

colossal supports of the roof of the catacombs, and was backed by one of their circumscribing walls of solid granite. </p>

I had scarcely laid the first tier of the masonry when I discovered that the intoxication 

of Fortunato had in a great measure worn off. The earliest indication I had of this was a low moaning cry from the depth of 

the recess. It was not the cry of a drunken man. There was then a long and obstinate silence. I laid the second tier, and the 

third, and the fourth; and then I heard the furious vibrations of the chain. The noise lasted for several minutes, during 

which, that I might hearken to it with the more satisfaction, I ceased my labours and sat down upon the bones. When at last 

the clanking subsided, I resumed the trowel, and finished without interruption the fifth, the sixth, and the seventh tier. 

The wall was now nearly upon a level with my breast. I again paused, and holding the flambeaux over the mason-work, threw a 

few feeble rays upon the figure within.</td>

with it about the recess; but the thought of an instant reassured me. I placed my hand upon the solid fabric of the 

catacombs, and felt satisfied. I reapproached the wall; I replied to the yells of him who clamoured. I re-echoed, I aided, I 

surpassed them in volume and in strength. I did this, and the clamourer grew still. </td>

out the niche a low laugh that erected the hairs upon my head. It was succeeded by a sad voice, which I had difficulty in 

recognizing as that of the noble Fortunato. The voice said &mdash; </p>

   <p>&quot;Ha! ha! ha! &mdash;he! he! he! &mdash;a very good joke, indeed &mdash;an excellent jest. We will have many a rich

&quot;He! he! he! &mdash;he! he! he! &mdash;yes, the Amontillado. But is it not getting late? 

Will not they be awaiting us at the palazzo, the Lady Fortunato and the rest? Let us be gone.&quot;</td>

No answer still. I thrust a torch through the remaining <a href="#" class="hintanchor" 

onMouseover="showhint('aperture = opening', this, event, '150px')">aperture</a> and let it fall within. There came forth in 

return only a jingling of the bells. My heart grew sick; it was the dampness of the catacombs that made it so. I hastened to 

make an end of my labour. I forced the last stone into its position; I plastered it up. Against the new masonry I re-erected

Directions: Answer the questions below.

<ol>
<li>Re-read the first paragraph of &quot;The Cask of Amontillado.&quot; What does the narrator think of himself? To whom might he be speaking?</li>

<li>The narrator tells us that he had dealt with &quot;injuries&quot; and finally even an &quot;insult&quot; from Fortunato. What examples can you find in the story to support the narrator's perception that Fortunato really is so rude?</li>

<li>In paragraph 42, Montresor says he drinks to Fortunato's &quot;long life.&quot; Now that you have read the whole story, what double meaning can you understand?</li>
<li>Re-read the final paragraph. Does Montresor feel any remorse for his actions? Explain your answer.</li>
<li>List two ways this story would be different if it were told by Fortunato, waiting to die in the crypt.</li>
