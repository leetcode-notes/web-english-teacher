TRUE! nervous, very, very dreadfully nervous I had been and am; but why WILL you say that I am mad? The disease had sharpened my senses, not destroyed, not dulled them. Above all was the sense of hearing <a href="#" class="hintanchor" onMouseover="showhint('acute = sharp, intense', this, event, '150px')">acute</a>. I heard all things in the heaven and in the earth. I heard many things in hell. How then am I mad? Hearken! and observe how healthily, how calmly, I can tell you the whole story.

It is impossible to say how first the idea entered my brain, but, once conceived, it haunted me day and night. Object there was none. Passion there was none. I loved the old man. He had never wronged me. He had never given me insult. For his gold I had no desire. I think it was his eye! Yes, it was this! One of his eyes resembled that of a vulture &mdash; a pale blue eye with a film over it. Whenever it fell upon me my blood ran cold, and so by degrees, very gradually, I made up my mind to take the life of the old man, and thus rid myself of the eye for ever.</td>

Now this is the point. You fancy me mad. Madmen know nothing. But you should have seen me. You should have seen how wisely I proceeded &mdash; with what caution &mdash; with what foresight, with what <a href="#" class="hintanchor" onMouseover="showhint('dissimulation = deception', this, event, '150px')">dissimulation</a>, I went to work! I was never kinder to the old man than during the whole week before I killed him. And every night about midnight I turned the latch of his door and opened it oh, so gently! And then, when I had made an opening <a href="#" class="hintanchor" onMouseover="showhint('sufficient = enough', this, event, '150px')">sufficient</a> for my head, I put in a dark lantern all closed, closed so that no light shone out, and then I thrust in my head. Oh, you would have laughed to see how cunningly I thrust it in! I moved it slowly, very, very slowly, so that I might not disturb the old man's sleep. It took me an hour to place my whole head within the opening so far that I could see him as he lay upon his bed. Ha! would a madman have been so wise as this? And then when my head was well in the room I undid the lantern cautiously &mdash; oh, so cautiously &mdash; cautiously (for the hinges creaked), I undid it just so much that a single thin ray fell upon the vulture eye. And this I did for seven long nights, every night just at midnight, but I found the eye always closed, and so it was impossible to do the work, for it was not the old man who vexed me but his Evil Eye. And every morning, when the day broke, I went boldly into the chamber and spoke courageously to him, calling him by name in a hearty tone, and inquiring how he had passed the night. So you see he would have been a very <a href="#" class="hintanchor" onMouseover="showhint('profound = insightful, smart', this, event, '150px')">profound</a> old man, indeed , to suspect that every night, just at twelve, I looked in upon him while he slept. </td>

Upon the eighth night I was more than usually cautious in opening the door. A watch's minute hand moves more quickly than did mine. Never before that night had I felt the extent of my own powers, of my <a href="#" class="hintanchor" onMouseover="showhint('sagacity = wisdom<br>Do you agree with the narrator that he is wise?', this, event, '150px')">sagacity</a>. I could scarcely contain my feelings of triumph. To think that there I was opening the door little by little, and he not even to dream of my secret deeds or thoughts. I fairly chuckled at the idea, and perhaps he heard me, for he moved on the bed suddenly as if startled. Now you may think that I drew back -- but no. His room was as black as pitch with the thick darkness (for the shutters were close fastened through fear of robbers), and so I knew that he could not see the opening of the door, and I kept pushing it on steadily, steadily.</td>

Presently, I heard a slight groan, and I knew it was the groan of mortal terror. It was not a groan of pain or of grief &mdash; oh, no! It was the low stifled sound that arises from the bottom of the soul when overcharged with awe. I knew the sound well. Many a night, just at midnight, when all the world slept, it has welled up from my own bosom, deepening, with its dreadful echo, the terrors that distracted me. I say I knew it well. I knew what the old man felt, and pitied him although I chuckled at heart. I knew that he had been lying awake ever since the first slight noise when he had turned in the bed. His fears had been ever since growing upon him. He had been trying to fancy them causeless, but could not. He had been saying to himself, "It is nothing but the wind in the chimney, it is only a mouse crossing the floor," or, "It is merely a cricket which has made a single chirp." Yes he has been trying to comfort himself with these suppositions; but he had found all <a href="#" class="hintanchor" onMouseover="showhint('in vain = useless', this, event, '150px')">in vain</a>. ALL IN VAIN, because Death in approaching him had stalked with his black shadow before him and enveloped the victim. And it was the mournful influence of the <a href="#" class="hintanchor" onMouseover="showhint('unperceived = unseen', this, event, '150px')">unperceived</a> shadow that caused him to feel, although he neither saw nor heard, to feel the presence of my head within the room.</td>

When I had waited a long time very patiently without hearing him lie down, I resolved to open a little &mdash; a very, very little <a href="#" class="hintanchor" onMouseover="showhint('crevice = crack, fissure', this, event, '150px')">crevice</a> in the lantern. So I opened it &mdash; you cannot imagine how stealthily, stealthily &mdash; until at length a single dim ray like the thread of the spider shot out from the crevice and fell upon the vulture eye.</td>

It was open, wide, wide open, and I grew furious as I gazed upon it. I saw it with perfect distinctness &mdash; all a dull blue with a hideous veil over it that chilled the very marrow in my bones, but I could see nothing else of the old man's face or person, for I had directed the ray as if by instinct precisely upon the damned spot.</td>

And now have I not told you that what you mistake for madness is but over-acuteness of the senses? now, I say, there came to my ears a low, dull, quick sound, such as a watch makes when enveloped in cotton. I knew that sound well too. It was the beating of the old man's heart. It increased my fury as the beating of a drum stimulates the soldier into courage.</td>

But even yet I refrained and kept still. I scarcely breathed. I held the lantern motionless. I tried how steadily I could maintain the ray upon the eye. Meantime the hellish <a href="#" class="hintanchor" onMouseover="showhint('tattoo = quick, rhythmic tapping', this, event, '150px')">tattoo</a> of the heart increased. It grew quicker and quicker, and louder and louder, every instant. The old man's terror must have been extreme! It grew louder, I say, louder every moment! &mdash; do you mark me well? I have told you that I am nervous: so I am. And now at the dead hour of the night, amid the dreadful silence of that old house, so strange a noise as this excited me to uncontrollable terror. Yet, for some minutes longer I refrained and stood still. But the beating grew louder, louder! I thought the heart must burst. And now a new anxiety seized me &mdash; the sound would be heard by a neighbour! The old man's hour had come! With a loud yell, I threw open the lantern and leaped into the room. He shrieked once &mdash; once only. In an instant I dragged him to the floor, and pulled the heavy bed over him. I then smiled gaily, to find the deed so far done. But for many minutes the heart beat on with a muffled sound. This, however, did not vex me; it would not be heard through the wall. At length it ceased. The old man was dead. I removed the bed and examined the corpse. Yes, he was stone, stone dead. I placed my hand upon the heart and held it there many minutes. There was no pulsation. He was stone dead. His eye would trouble me no more. </td>

I then replaced the boards so cleverly so cunningly, that no human eye &mdash; not even his &mdash; could have detected anything wrong.

When I had made an end of these labours, it was four o'clock &mdash; still dark as midnight. As the bell sounded the hour, there came a knocking at the street door.

There entered three men, who introduced themselves, with perfect <a href="#" class="hintanchor" onMouseover="showhint('suavity = grace or style', this, event, '150px')">suavity</a>, as officers of the police. A shriek had been heard by a neighbour during the night; suspicion of foul play had been aroused; information had been lodged at the police office, and they (the officers) had been <a href="#" class="hintanchor" onMouseover="showhint('deputed = assigned or sent', this, event, '150px')">deputed</a> to search the premises. </td>

In the enthusiasm of my confidence, I brought chairs into the room, and desired them here to rest from their fatigues, while I myself, in the wild <a href="#" class="hintanchor" onMouseover="showhint('audacity = boldness', this, event, '150px')">audacity</a> of my perfect triumph, placed my own seat upon the very spot beneath which <a href="#" class="hintanchor" onMouseover="showhint('reposed = rested', this, event, '150px')">reposed</a> the corpse of the victim.</td>

The officers were satisfied. My MANNER had convinced them. I was singularly at ease. They sat and while I answered cheerily, they chatted of familiar things. But, ere long, I felt myself getting pale and wished them gone. My head ached, and I fancied a ringing in my ears; but still they sat, and still chatted.
