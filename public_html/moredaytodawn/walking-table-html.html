<p>I wish to speak a word for Nature, for absolute freedom and wildness, as contrasted with a freedom and culture merely civil--to regard man as an inhabitant, or a part and parcel of Nature, rather than a member of society. I wish to make an extreme statement, if so I may make an emphatic one, for there are enough champions of civilization: the minister and the school committee and every one of you will take care of that.</p>

  <p>I have met with but one or two persons in the course of my life who understood the art of Walking, that is, of taking walks--who had a genius, so to speak, for <a href="#" class="hintanchor" onMouseover="showhint('to saunter = to stroll, to walk in a leisurely manner', this, event, '150px')">sauntering</a>, which word is beautifully derived "from idle people who roved about the country, in the Middle Ages, and asked charity, under pretense of going <em>a la Sainte Terre</em>," to the Holy Land, till the children exclaimed, "There goes a <em>Sainte-Terrer</em>," a Saunterer, a Holy-Lander. They who never go to the Holy Land in their walks, as they pretend, are indeed mere idlers and vagabonds; but they who do go there are saunterers in the good sense, such as I mean. Some, however, would derive the word from <em>sans terre</em>, without land or a home, which, therefore, in the good sense, will mean, having no particular home, but equally at home everywhere. For this is the secret of successful sauntering. He who sits still in a house all the time may be the greatest vagrant of all; but the saunterer, in the good sense, is no more vagrant than the meandering river, which is all the while <a href="#" class="hintanchor" onMouseover="showhint('sedulously = carefully, diligently', this, event, '150px')">sedulously</a> seeking the shortest course to the sea.

  <p>It is true, we are but faint-hearted crusaders, even the walkers, nowadays, who undertake no persevering, never-ending enterprises. Our expeditions are but tours, and come round again at evening to the old hearth-side from which we set out. Half the walk is but retracing our steps. We should go forth on the shortest walk, perchance, in the spirit of undying adventure, never to return&#8212;prepared to send back our embalmed hearts only as relics to our desolate kingdoms. If you are ready to leave father and mother, and brother and sister, and wife and child and friends, and never see them again&#8212;if you have paid your debts, and made your will, and settled all your affairs, and are a free man&#8212;then you are ready for a walk. ...</p>

  <p>The merit of this bird's strain is in its freedom from all <a href="#" class="hintanchor" onMouseover="showhint('plaintiveness = melancholy, sadness', this, event, '150px')">plaintiveness</a>. The singer can easily move us to tears or to laughter, but where is he who can excite in us a pure morning joy? When, in doleful dumps, breaking the awful stillness of our wooden sidewalk on a Sunday, or, perchance, a watcher in the house of mourning, I hear a <a href="#" class="hintanchor" onMouseover="showhint('cockerel = young rooster', this, event, '150px')">cockerel</a> crow far or near, I think to myself, "There is one of us well, at any rate,"&#8212;and with a sudden gush return to my senses.</p></td></tr>

  <p>We had a remarkable sunset one day last November. I was walking in a meadow, the source of a small brook, when the sun at last, just before setting, after a cold, gray day, reached a clear <a href="#" class="hintanchor" onMouseover="showhint('stratum = layer', this, event, '150px')">stratum</a> in the horizon, and the softest, brightest morning sunlight fell on the dry grass and on the stems of the trees in the opposite horizon and on the leaves of the shrub oaks on the hillside, while our shadows stretched long over the meadow eastward, as if we were the only motes in its beams. It was such a light as we could not have imagined a moment before, and the air also was so warm and serene that nothing was wanting to make a paradise of that meadow. When we reflected that this was not a solitary phenomenon, never to happen again, but that it would happen forever and ever, an infinite number of evenings, and cheer and reassure the latest child that walked there, it was more glorious still.</p></td></tr>

  <p>The sun sets on some retired meadow, where no house is visible, with all the glory and splendor that it lavishes on cities, and perchance as it has never set before--where there is but a solitary marsh hawk to have his wings <a href="#" class="hintanchor" onMouseover="showhint('gilded = made golden', this, event, '150px')">gilded</a> by it, or only a <a href="#" class="hintanchor" onMouseover="showhint('musquash = muskrat', this, event, '150px')">musquash</a> looks out from his cabin, and there is some little black-veined brook in the midst of the marsh, just beginning to meander, winding slowly round a decaying stump. We walked in so pure and bright a light, gilding the withered grass and leaves, so softly and serenely bright, I thought I had never bathed in such a golden flood, without a ripple or a murmur to it. The west side of every wood and rising ground gleamed like the boundary of <a href="#" class="hintanchor" onMouseover="showhint('Elysium = heaven', this, event, '150px')">Elysium</a>, and the sun on our backs seemed like a gentle herdsman driving us home at evening.</p></td></tr>

  <p>So we saunter toward the Holy Land, till one day the sun shall shine more brightly than ever he has done, shall perchance shine into our minds and hearts, and light up our whole lives with a great awakening light, as warm and serene and golden as on a bankside in autumn.</p></td></tr>
